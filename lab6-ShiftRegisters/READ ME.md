## Lab6 Shift Registers

When several flip-flops are grouped together, with a common clock, to hold related information the resulting circuit is called a register. Just like flip-flops, registers may also have other control signals. You will understand the behavior of a register with additional control signals. Counters are widely used sequential circuits. In this lab you will model several ways of modeling registers and counters.

Create these labs. Just do an RTL-schematic screen shot and something interesting device screen shot. Test them.  Copy all the bit files to a single folder so they can be demonstrated quickly all at once. 

The major take away from this lab is able to model various types of registers and various types of counters.
