# Lab 7 Behavior_Modeling

In lab 1, the behavior was introduced as one of three widely used modeling styles.

In lab 4, additional capabilities with the respect to test benches were further introduced

In this lab, learn more language constructs and timing constraint concepts

The major to take away this lab is able to use various language constructs using behavioral modeling and to communicate timing expectations through timing constraints

Read [For Loop Pipelining example](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2015_2/sdsoc_doc/topics/calling-coding-guidelines/concept_pipelining_loop_unrolling.html)

Write down the concept of Loop Pipelining on notebook.

#### Prompt

PORT_A signal will get the value of 8'20 at 0, value of 8'hF2 at 5 (DELAY + 0=5+0=5), value of 8'h41 at 10, value of 8'h0A at 15
